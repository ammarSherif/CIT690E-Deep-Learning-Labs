# About the course
This repo includes my lab teaching tutorials and material for the CIT690E Deep Learning course. It is a postgraduate course that aims to build student experience with Deep Learning topics including the common architectures in different applications among the concerns while training, ... etc.

I believe building the *intuition* while learning Deep Learning is quite crucial in order to have a transferable knowledge to other different applications. Therefore, during the labs, that is what I was mainly concerned about in addition to common issues like data imbalance and similar issues.
